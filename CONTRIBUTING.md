## Manual of Style
Please adhere to this style guide when editing the tutorial content.

### Language
This tutorial is written in [Oxford English spelling] (British English
with -ize and -yse endings).

#### Complexity
This tutorial was primarily written for beginners and those who are learning or
looking to learn, so it's important that you clearly explain concepts that may
seem simple to you, as if introducing someone new to this topic for the very
first time.

However, don't be too overzealous with this and start treating the readers as 5
year olds. We don't want to come off as arrogant.

#### Tone
Try to write in a formal, instructive tone in the tutorial content. Jokes and
informal speech aren't quite appropriate in the tutorial itself, but, of
course, may freely be in the comments section.

#### Pronouns
Prefer referring to the person reading the tutorial as "you".

When a gender is unknown or variable (such as, say, when gender is a chosen
option in a CYOA), use the 3rd person singular epicene pronouns **they/them**
rather than the masculine default **he/him** to refer to them.

Always prefer **they/them** to **he or she** (or vice versa) or **s(he)**,
as this excludes non-binary people or people who prefer to use other pronouns.

#### Punctuation
Use the [Oxford comma]:

* **DO** this: Tom, Dick<b>,</b> and Harry
* **DON'T** do this: Tom, Dick and Harry

#### Line length limit
In Markdown files, you'll quickly notice that words do not go past 79 lines.
This is to ensure clear reading on smaller monitors, a stylistic choice, and a
way to ensure that code is readable and not spread out.

There *are* exceptions of course, such as URLs (but only at the bottom of a
page) and tables.

### Date and Time
When referring to dates and times, use UTC. If this is not possible at the
current moment, you can use the date and/or time you have, but please clearly
mark the timezone in brackets (), or state that the time zone's unknown.

### Exceptions
Exceptions to this style guide can be made if it's someone or something being
quoted.
