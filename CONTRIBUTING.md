## Manual of Style
Please adhere to this style guide when editing the tutorial content.

### Language
This tutorial is written in [Oxford English spelling][oxen] (British English
with -ize and -yse endings), so please adhere to that.

It's fine if you don't, however, as it can simply be corrected in a later
version.

#### Pronouns
When a gender is unknown or variable (such as, when gender is a chosen option
in a CYOA), use the 3rd person singular epicene pronouns **they/them** rather
than the masculine default **he/him** to refer to them.

Always prefer **they/them** to **he** or **she** (or vice versa) or **s(he)**,
as this excludes non-binary people or people who prefer to use other pronouns.

#### Puncutation
Use the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma):

* **DO** this: Tom, Dick<b>,</b> and Harry
* **DON'T** do this: Tom, Dick and Harry

### Markdown
In Markdown files, you'll quickly notice that words do not go past 79 lines.
This is to ensure clear reading on smaller monitors, a stylistic choice, and a
way to ensure that code is readable and not spread out.

There *are* exceptions of course, such as URLs (but only at the bottom of a
page) and tables.
