## TODO
- [ ] Finish the base tutorial
    - [x] Finish the Introduction section
    - [x] Finish the Basics section
    - [x] Finish the Mechanics section
        - [x] Rows
        - [x] Objects / Choices
        - [x] Addons
        - [x] Backpack & Choice Import
        - [x] IDs & Requirements
        - [x] Points & Scores
        - [x] Images
        - [x] Defaults
        - [x] Words
        - [x] Buttons (& Variables)
        - [x] Groups
    - [ ] Finish the Styling section
        - [ ] Design – Basically like, design theory
        - [ ] Style Templates
        - [ ] Colour – How you should choose colour, where to put it
        - [ ] Backgrounds
            - [ ] Link to static background in Reference, or vice versa
        - [ ] Text
        - [ ] Filters
        - [ ] Private Styling
    - [ ] Finish the Publishing section
    - [x] Finish the Extending Your CYOA section
    - [ ] Finish the Reference section
    - [ ] Finish the Troubleshooting section
    - [x] Finish the Resources section (will it ever be truly finished?)
- [ ] Add a section detailing how to get pages.dev, netlify.app, etc.
- [ ] Add a End-of-tutorial Project where there's a step by step remake of a
CYOA.
- [ ] Add JavaScript to show when, from now, a release happened
- [ ] Delete unneeded JavaScript
- [x] Find a way to count words and characters
- [ ] Delete ideologically-driven information, such as git. The people most
likely do not need nor want to know that.
- [ ] After the ICCT is written, go through the main tutorial and add
everything that is possible into the Mechanics
- [x] Compress all the gifs to limit bandwidth, but not enough such that the
  gifs lose legibility. Use `gifsicle` in a python script.
- [ ] Standardize "after"/"result"/"with" and "before"/"without" etc
  tabbed titles
- [ ] Chill with the quotes, and instead rewrite the quotes into information in
  my own words.
- [ ] Add my own custom Viewer js file, this time adding:
    - [ ] `alt` attribute for `<img>`s
    - [ ] `referrerpolicy` attribute for `<a>` links
- [ ] Make a chapter detailing how to actually *create* ICYOAs
    - [ ] Section on OCR, including my command line tool, caveats, etc
    - [ ] Section on finding the text, seeing if there's a Google Doc –
      Mentioning possibly asking the authors for a text version
    - [ ] Section on handwriting it
    - [ ] Advice on asking the author if they have a Google Doc of it, so that
      you can more easily copy it?
- [ ] Add tip block when talking about the Viewer, mentioning that projects
  automatically start at the `index.html`, meaning they don't need to include
  that in the title (and it looks nicer)
