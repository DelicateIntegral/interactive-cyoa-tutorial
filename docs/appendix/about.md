        - [x] Objects / Choices
        - [x] Addons
        - [x] Backpack & Choice Import
        - [x] IDs & Requirements
        - [x] Points & Scores
        - [x] Images
        - [x] Defaults
        - [x] Words
        - [x] Buttons (& Variables)
        - [x] Groups
    - [ ] Finish the Styling section
        - [ ] Design – Basically like, design theory
        - [x] Style Templates
        - [ ] Colours – How you should choose colour, where to put it
        - [ ] Backgrounds
            - [ ] Link to static background in Reference, or vice versa
        - [ ] Text
        - [ ] Filters
        - [ ] Private Styling
    - [x] Finish the Creating Your CYOA section
    - [x] Finish the Extending Your CYOA section
    - [ ] Finish the Publishing section
    - [ ] Finish the Reference section
    - [ ] Finish the Troubleshooting section
    - [x] Finish the Resources section (will it ever be truly finished?)
- [ ] Add a section detailing how to get pages.dev, netlify.app, etc.
- [ ] Add a End-of-tutorial Project where there's a step by step remake of a
CYOA.
- [ ] Add JavaScript to show when, from now, a release happened
- [ ] Delete unneeded JavaScript
- [ ] Delete ideologically-driven information, such as git. The people most
likely do not need nor want to know that.
- [ ] After the ICCT is written, go through the main tutorial and add
everything that is possible into the Mechanics
- [ ] Standardize "after"/"result"/"with" and "before"/"without" etc
  tabbed titles
- [ ] Chill with the quotes, and instead rewrite the quotes into information in
  my own words.
- [ ] Add my own custom Viewer js file, this time adding:
    - [ ] `alt` attribute for `<img>`s
    - [ ] `referrerpolicy` attribute for `<a>` links
- [ ] Add tip block when talking about the Viewer, mentioning that projects
  automatically start at the `index.html`, meaning they don't need to include
  that in the title (and it looks nicer)
- [ ] Change template example images in the **Style Templates** section to
  include buttons that are being pressed, images, and other elements
- [ ] Specify that content indicated by a `!!! quote` admonition and in code
  blocks (when explicitly said or noted as quoted) as not licensed under the
  content licence.
- [ ] Finish the **Publishing** section and then upload it to reddit

### Completed

- [x] Compress all the gifs to limit bandwidth, but not enough such that the
  gifs lose legibility. Use `gifsicle` in a python script.
- [x] Find a way to count words and characters
- [x] Make a chapter detailing how to actually *create* ICYOAs
    - [x] Section on OCR, including my command line tool, caveats, etc
    - [x] Section on finding the text, seeing if there's a Google Doc –
      Mentioning possibly asking the authors for a text version
    - [x] Section on handwriting it
    - [x] Advice on asking the author if they have a Google Doc of it, so that
      you can more easily copy it?
- [x] Consider changing the content licence to CC0 (Public Domain).

### v0.15.0 (WIP)
_Released on DATE at TIME UTC_

_Words: WORDS_

_Reading Time: READINGTIME_

* Added to **Design** page
* Changed the licence of all content to the [CC0] Public Domain licence
* Moved Licence section in the About page up above TODO and Changelog
* Put TODO under the Roadmap section, and separated TODO into TODO and
  Completed to better get rid of unneeded text
* Added a video tutorial to **Backpack and Choice Import** which helps the
  **Static** publishing page
* Added a lot to the Reference
* Updated lots of other sections
* Added Choice Copying that undoubtedly would have been in the lost **Copying**
  section
* Changed README.md to talk about why [https://icctutorial.pages.dev][icct] is
  the preferable URL
* Added abbreviations for Cf. and cf.
* Added to the Reference
* Added a `requirements.txt` file so that it's easier to self-host this website
* Upgraded `mkdocs-material` from 9.2.0b0 to 9.2.0b1
* Changed GitHub actions workflow to use requirements.txt
* Compressed gifs once more
* Deleted `mkdocs-material` folder that I hosted locally, now that
  requirements.txt would make it defunct
* Deleted `venvold/`, another local folder
* Moved all of the top-level scripts into the `scripts/` directory for
  organizational purposes
* Made a new cross-platform word count python script
* Realized that the old word count script was counting **EVERYTHING** in the
  root directory, including docs belonging to venv and mkdocs-material.
  Rerunning it only within `docs/` changed the total from `121,255` (0.14.0) to
  `21,359` (whilst developing 0.15.0). It appears I had vastly overestimated my
  word count.
* Finally deleted the `old/` directory
* Spelling corrections
* Moved the **Authors** field from below the comments section to above it, in
  line with the "Last update" and "Created" metadata.
* Fixed some dead links
* Updated Words fields on the About page with the more accurate amount of
  plaintext words typed (as opposed to all words counting the Markdown)
* Added word count for v0.12.0 and below
*
