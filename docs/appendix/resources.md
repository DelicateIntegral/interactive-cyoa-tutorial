## Interactive CYOA Creator

* [Online version](https://intcyoacreator.onrender.com/)
* [Offline version at itch.io (one-time purchase of 2.50 USD or more)][icc]

## Social Media
### Reddit

* [r/InteractiveCYOA] – A subreddit for Interactive CYOAs. If you make an
Interactive, feel free to showcase it here!
* [r/makeyourchoice] – The original CYOA subreddit. Interactives are accepted
but only if you link the static. If you are creating an original interactive,
either [export it as a static] or create a static manually.
* [r/nsfwcyoa] – A subreddit for NSFW CYOAs.

### Discord
Here are some discord servers that relate to CYOAs and Interactive CYOAs.

* [PixelGMS's Interactive CYOAs] – The primary discord server for Interactive
CYOAs. It was made by [u/PixelGMS], who is the creator of the
[r/InteractiveCYOA] subreddit.
    * If you join, go into `#roles` and get the `CYOA Making Channels` role.
    This will let you join `#cyoa-making`, a channel that *will* help you,
    should you get stuck on something. 
* [makeyourchoice] – A discord server for the [r/makeyourchoice] subreddit.
* [NSFWCYOA] – A discord server for the [r/nsfwcyoa] subreddit.
* [/CYOA/] – A discord server from 4chan.
* [CYOA][CYOA-discord] – Another discord server from 4chan.

## Tutorials
Credits to these tutorials and information sources for helping me make this
tutorial.

Neocities, which is also covered in *this* tutorial

### Static CYOAs
Resources primarily for Static CYOAs. May still apply to creating Interactives.

* [How to Create a CYOA] – From the official [r/makeyourchoice] subreddit, this
  guide is focused more on static CYOAs. However, should you create an
  Interactive from scratch rather than adapating them, this could help you.

  descriptions of your own content.

## CYOAs
### Archives
Actual downloadable CYOAs.

* [The Allsync](https://cyoaarchive.com/main) – The Allsync is perhaps **the**
definitive CYOA archive. It contains almost all static CYOAs, taking up a
whopping total of 103.7 GB as of writing this.
    * [Alternate link][allsync-latest].
    * [The Blog](https://cyoaarchive.blogspot.com/)
* [CYOA Dropbox][cyoadb] – A Dropbox with a lot of CYOAs

    !!! quote "Message from the creator"

        Hello friends, I am the guy who owns the Dropbox linked up top. I added
        a notepad to the dropbox. If you are a CYOA author and wish to see your 
        CYOA in the dropbox, the most expedient way would be emailing my new
        Yahoo! account "Dropboxanon@yahoo.com' with the CYOA. Adding a name
        either in the subject or body attached to the email would be helpful.

* [TokHaar Gol's CYOAs] – For [reasons I won't get into][tok], TokHar Gool's
CYOAs don't tend to be included in archives. This is his personal Google Drive
with his CYOAs.

### Indexes
Catalogues and links to CYOAs.

* [Infaera's Interactive Index](https://infaera.neocities.org/) – By
[u/Infaera]. A solid index of Interactive CYOAs, containing 406 entries.
    * [Reddit post][infaera-post]

in a separate sheet. Also has a lot of sorting options. 1571 main entries and
258 Interactive entries as of writing.

[u/PixelGMS]. It contains 57 entries.
    * [Reddit post][pixel-post]

  effectively infinite points.

  stories.
