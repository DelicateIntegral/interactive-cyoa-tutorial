# Troubleshooting
Welcome to the Troubleshooting section. Have a bug? It should be listed here,
with any solutions documented.

If you encounter a bug that is not on this list, please comment below. If
anyone knows of a fix it will be documented here so future creators will know
how to solve it.

## Design
### I can't find the option to upload a background image
This creator is rather buggy at times, and sometimes it hides the options:
**Upload Background Image**, **Upload TODO Image**, and **Upload TODO Image**
in the **Manage Background Design** section.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

There are two methods of fixing this, both of which will be displayed here.

Either:

1. [Zoom in and out][zoom], or
2. Resize the window

=== "Zooming"

    ![](../images/73_resizing_fix.gif)

=== "Resizing with Console"

    !!! tip

        You can open the console by going ++ctrl++ + ++shift++ + ++i++.

=== "Resizing entire window"

    ![](../images/75_resizing_window.gif)

!!! tip

    You should probably just focus on [zooming][zoom] instead of resizing,
    as resizing the window gets a bit tricky sometimes.

!!! warning

    If this bug occurs to you, exiting the Creator and coming back in will 
    probably reset the fix, meaning you will have to do this everytime you
    encounter the issue.
