# Buttons

## Adding Buttons
You can add a button by opening up **Edit Row** â†’ **Button?**. You will find
the switch on the left hand side.

=== "Off"

=== "On"

    ![](../images/132_button_option_on.png)

If you go out of the Row menu now, you should see a button on the Row:

It's useless for the moment, but we can change that by pressing
**Open Button Settings**.

## Open Button Settings
You should see this screen now:

We'll walk you through this whole section.

### Button Text
This field lets decide what the text on the button says.

=== "Field"

=== "Preview"

Now, your Button is still useless as it is. You change that by pressing either
**Point Type Sum Addon** or **Other**.

### Point Type Sum Addon
This, along with "Other" is one of two modes you can set your button to.

#### Button will add a sum to a Point-type
### Other
#### Variable
#### Random or variable?
This is, by default, off.
#### Toggleable?
This is, by default, on.
