# Points and Scores

## Points
!!! quote

    Point systems can be created and used to handle the player's ability to buy
    things and to keep a record of selected choices in a group or row.

### The Point Types Menu
To open the menu, go into **[the Sidebar]** → **Open Features** → **Manage
Points**.

### Creating Point Types
To create a Point Type, simply press **Create New Point Type**. Afterward, the
Point Type sub-menu will pop up, one for each Point Type:

### The Pointtype Id
The **The Pointtype Id** input field is where you can assign your own [ID][ids]
to your Point Type.

### The Pointtype Name
To name a Point Type, simply enter the name in the **The Pointtype Name** input
box. Its full name is usually cut off however, though you can find it in the
centre of the top row.

### Starting Sum
The **Starting Sum** input field determines how many of that Point Type the
players will start with by default.

!!! note

    **Starting Sum** is always linked to the current value. That means if you
    select a choice by default for your user that affects this Point Type then
    it will change the Starting Sum too.

### Id Needed To Show
The **Id Needed To Show** input field is a special one. By placing the ID of a
[Choice][choice] there, the Point Type will not show in the Point Bar at the
bottom of the screen until the Choice with that ID is selected.

### Text Before Number
The **Text Before Number** input displays what shows before its value on the
Point Bar.

Generally speaking, the recommended format for this is just your Point Type ID
without underscores and in title case.

### Text After Number

### (Move to ref) The Power of Hidden Point Types
I find it particularly useful in hidden point types that determine how much of
a thing you’re allowed to select

### Subtracting Points
This is the default behaviour. 

### Adding Points

### Text Before
Change to something like “Gain:” or “Gives:” when adding points, but keep it at
"Cost:" when subtracting points.

### Show Score?
This can be used to hide mechanics, or if the image shows the points already.

Discounts can be made using requirements.
