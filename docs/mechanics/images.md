## Important advice
!!! tip

    It is advisable that you do not upload images until the core mechanics of 
    the CYOA are complete. The vast majority of space that an Interactive CYOA 
    takes up is due to images, and a huge amount of images will slow down lower
    end PCs. CYOAs over 300 MB are known to have caused issues.

There are pros and cons to using both local and external images for choices.

| Upload type  | Pros                                          | Cons                                                                                                                  | Use case                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Local**    | + Faster<br>+ More reliable                   | - Takes up space (too much space can crash the creator, and most free website hosts limit how much space you can use) | Smaller projects (<300 MB) |
| **External** | + You keep the size of your project.json down | - Slower<br>- You have to trust the servers won't delete the image                                                    | Larger projects (>300 MB)  |
