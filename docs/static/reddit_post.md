# Complete Interactive CYOA Tutorial

Link: [https://icctutorial.pages.dev](https://icctutorial.pages.dev)

This is a tutorial and guide for the Interactive CYOA Creator by MeanDelay. If
you wanted to learn how to use the creator as a beginner, are stuck on
something, or just need a refresher, then this guide hopes to cover all of it.

<!-- For early release only -->
The Mechanics section is (almost) completely done, but as a whole it's not
complete just yet. The only thing that really needs work is the Styling section
and the Reference.

<!-- For r/NSFWCYOA only -->
Although this tutorial shouldn't necessarily be NSFW, I've posted here instead
of r/makeyourchoice because there are a couple of NSFW images and links to NSFW
sites, and I wanted to be safe just in case.

Suggestions are, of course, welcome, and as this project is
[open-source](https://github.com/upasadena/interactive-cyoa-tutorial/), anyone
is free to contribute :)
