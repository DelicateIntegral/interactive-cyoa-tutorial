# Complete Interactive CYOA Tutorial

Link: [https://icctutorial.pages.dev](https://icctutorial.pages.dev)

This is a tutorial and guide for the Interactive CYOA Creator by MeanDelay.
Whether you wanted to learn how to use the creator as a beginner, are stuck on
something, or just need a refresher, this guide hopes to cover all of it!

<!-- For early release only -->
Disclaimer: This tutorial is still in development (on stable version 0.17.0 as
of writing this). The Mechanics section is (almost) completely done, but the
tutorial as a whole is not yet complete. The only things that really need work
are the Styling section and the Reference.
<!-- End early release -->

<!-- For r/NSFWCYOA only -->
Although this tutorial shouldn't necessarily be NSFW, I've posted here instead
of r/makeyourchoice because there are a couple of NSFW images and links to NSFW
sites, and I wanted to be safe just in case.
<!-- End r/NSFWCYOA -->

Suggestions are, of course, welcome, and as this project is
[open-source](https://github.com/upasadena/interactive-cyoa-tutorial/), anyone
is free to contribute :)
