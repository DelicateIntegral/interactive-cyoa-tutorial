# Complete Interactive CYOA Creator Tutorial

Link: [https://icctutorial.pages.dev](https://icctutorial.pages.dev)

<!-- For early release only -->
This is a tutorial and guide for using the Interactive CYOA Creator by
MeanDelay. If you want to learn how to use the creator, are stuck on something,
or just need a refresher this guide hopes to cover it.

The Mechanics section is completely done, but as a whole it's not complete just
yet. The only thing that really needs work is the Styling section, and as this
project is
[open-source](https://github.com/upasadena/interactive-cyoa-tutorial/), anyone
is free to contribute.

<!-- For r/NSFWCYOA only -->
Although this tutorial shouldn't necessarily be NSFW, I've posted here instead
of r/makeyourchoice because there are a couple of NSFW images and links to NSFW
sites, and I wanted to be safe just in case.
