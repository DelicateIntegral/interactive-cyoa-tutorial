# Introduction
This section of the tutorial will be focused on familiarizing you with the
interface.

## Launching the Creator
When you launch the creator for the first time, you will be greeted with this
screen:

### Open Image-CYOA Creator
This is where you go to create **Interactive CYOAs**.

When you first open it, you will be greeted with a blank screen and a minimized
sidebar. To learn more about the sidebar, go to [The Sidebar](#the-sidebar).

This is what a complete CYOA would look like in this menu:

### Open Image-CYOA Viewer
This is where you can preview CYOAs before you upload them. You can play them,
but options selected in the viewer will persist in the editor, so make sure you
[reset the options](../mechanics/choices.md#Resetting choices).

### Help and Instructions
A small tutorial made by the author themself. It should be redundant with this
tutorial, but you may wish to check it out anyway.

### The Sidebar
The sidebar is how you manoeuvre around the creator.

#### Return To Menu
This takes you back to the [start][2].

#### Create New Row
This is how you create rows. See more [here][1].

#### Open Row List
This lists all the rows inside of the interactive. It lists them with their ID
by default, but, if given a title, it will use that instead.

You can select individual rows to expand them and see choices:

#### Open Features
Pressing _Open Features_ will present you with one of the most important menus
in the creator. It grants you access to a lot of the mechanics, such as
[points], [defaults], the [Backpack and Choice Import], and
[image compression].

All these features will be elaborated later on, and so need not be talked about
in detail here.

#### Modify Design
The _Modify Design_ button will open up the key to designing your CYOA. This is
quite important if you wish for your CYOA to be approachable and appealing
visually. You can learn more about it [here](../styling/).
