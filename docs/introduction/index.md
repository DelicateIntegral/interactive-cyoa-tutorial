## Launching the Creator
When you launch the creator for the first time, you will be greeted with this
screen:

### Open Image-CYOA Creator
This is where you go to create **Interactive CYOAs**.

When you first open it, you will be greeted with a blank screen and a minimized
sidebar. To learn more about the sidebar, go to [The Sidebar](#the-sidebar).

### Open Image-CYOA Viewer
This is where you can preview CYOAs before you upload them. You can play them,
but options selected in the viewer will persist in the editor, so make sure you
[reset the options](../mechanics/choices.md#Resetting choices).

A small tutorial made by the author themself. It should be redundant with this
tutorial, but you may wish to check it out anyway.
