# Introduction
Hello, and welcome to the Interactive CYOA Creator Tutorial!

If you would like to jump straight into the tutorial, press the button below.

Otherwise, I'll be doing some advance discussion on the Interactive CYOA
Creator and this tutorial in the rest of this Preface.

## Purpose
The reason I created this tutorial to start with is due to the amount of
questions I would see in the [r/InteractiveCYOA] subreddit asking "How do I do
X?" and "Why isn't Y working?", and so on. I decided to create a single,
localized repository of information containing all there is to know about the
ICC, so that nobody would ever need to reasonably ask 99% of the time, should
they have read this tutorial.

## Clarity
I have endeavoured to make this tutorial as straightforward to follow as
possible, and to that end most examples have a gif, image, or video
accompanying the text in order to more properly understand how the creator
works.

## Limitations
The ICC is an incredible tool which has vastly improved the quality of
Interactive CYOAs. However, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that it
too has limitations.

First, the Creator is no longer being actively maintained. It was last updated
on 28 February 2021. This means no new features are likely to be added, no bugs
will be fixed, and one far off day, the program may not longer be compatible
with our current technologies.

Second, the project is not open-source. This ties into the first point, being
that if it were open-source, the community could fork the repository, and
continue to develop it, adding new features and fixing bugs. As it is not, our
only options are to create a new one (unlikely any time soon) or to continue to
use this tool.

## Glossary
Many terms may produce confusion, so we'll define them here:

* Object – Also known as a "Choice"
* object – Any distinct entity made with the Interactive CYOA Creator, such as
a Row, Choice/Object, Point, etc
    * To differentiate between generic objects and choice objects, choice
    objects will always be spelt with a capital letter—Objects—or be referred
    to as Choices
* ICC – The Interactive CYOA Creator
* Creator – The Interactive CYOA Creator, always with an uppercase letter
* creator – Any creator, always with a lowercase letter

## Conclusion
With all that said, I hope you enjoy and learn something new from this
tutorial. Good luck and have fun!
