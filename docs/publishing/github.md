# Publishing on Github

## Usage Limits
GitHub has these limits:
* A recommended limit of 1 GB per repository
* A *soft* bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month
* A *soft* build limit of 10 builds per hour, if using the default GitHub
Pages, rather than a custom GitHub actions workflow

See [here][github-usage-limits] for more info.
