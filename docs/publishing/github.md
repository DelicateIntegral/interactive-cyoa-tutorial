# Publishing on Github

## Usage Limits
GitHub has these limits:
* A recommended limit of 1 GB per repository
* A *soft* bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month
* A *soft* build limit of 10 builds per hour, if using the default GitHub
Pages, rather than a custom GitHub actions workflow

See [here][github-usage-limits] for more info.

## Free custom subdomains
You may have noticed that this tutorial has a pages.dev subdomain (if you are
viewing from https://icctutorial.pages.dev/). This was gained for free at
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). We won't get into setting
that up as of now (but it is planned), but feel free to visit that site on your
own and view the docs.
