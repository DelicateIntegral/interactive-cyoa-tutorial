# Static
Creating a static image from your CYOA is very easy, as the ICC has in-built
functionality that allows it.

!!! note

    In order for this to work fully, you should scroll completely down so that
    all of the images in your CYOA are loaded.

    Otherwise, downloading the static might have images that aren't loaded.

## Downloading your Choices
Unfortunately, with the default Backpack you cannot download the entire CYOA
as-is (at least, not without extensive modification to the Backpack, which will
be discussed [here][bkp]), and instead can only download a picture of all the
Choices you have selected.

[bkp]: #downloading-the-entire-static-image

First, make sure that [the Backpack] is enabled.

[the Backpack]: /mechanics/backpack-and-choice-import/#the-backpack

Second, click on it and scroll all the way down to the bottom to make sure that
all images are loaded.

Third, Press the **Download Image (Go all the way to the bottom to load in**
**the pictures first)** button. This will prompt you with your file manager and
you can save your `canvas.jpg` wherever you wish.

??? note "Unimplemented method"

    To get the static image, do these steps:

    1. Open the **Creator** and load your project
    2. Go back and open up the **Viewer**
    3. Open up all Rows and select all Choices that will enable you to see the
    CYOA in its entirety
    4. Scroll down to the very bottom of the CYOA
    5. Scroll back up
    6. Press the **Download Image (Go all the way to the bottom to load in**
    **the pictures first)** button

    !!! note

        Unfortunately, this is unfinished as of the latest IntCyoaCreator
        update.

## Downloading the entire Static Image
How can you download the entire CYOA and not just your selected Choices? Well,
you _can_ hack it to show all Choices by giving yourself 9999 points and
selecting every Choice, but Rows won't show.

So instead, follow the steps [here][backpack-rows].

Then, go through each and every Row made there and tick 

## Splitting the images
You should probably split the long massive image into multiple images before
uploading anywhere.
