# Reference
This is the reference for Interactive CYOA creators. 

While the rest of the tutorial focuses on individual concepts within the
creator, this section focuses on real issues and desired outcomes, and walks
you through how to achieve it.

## Whole CYOA
### Changing the page title
In order to change the title of the tab in the browser, simply edit
`index.html`.

Look for:
```html
<title>CYOA</title>
```
and replace "CYOA" with whatever you want the title to be.

One title format is `{CYOA name}: Interactive`, but whatever works for you is
fine.

### Table of Contents / Tab Menu

## Rows
### Hide Rows behind a Choice
Use a [Selected Choice] requirement.

## Choices
### You may only pick X options
See [here](../mechanics/rows/#allowed-choices).

### Choice requires anothers Choice
See [here][choice_requires_another_choice]

## Requirements
### Logic Gates and Requirements
| Logic Gate | Explanation                                     | Requirement |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **AND**    | True only if all IDs are selected               | [GOTO][AND] |
| **OR**     | True if at least one ID is selected             | [GOTO][OR]  |
| **NOT**    | True if an ID is not selected                   | [GOTO][NOT] |
| **NOR**    | True when all IDs are not selected              | [GOTO][NOR] |
| **NAND**   | True unless all IDs are selected                |             |
| **XAND**   | True if all IDs are either selected or not      |             |
| **XOR**    | True if one ID is selected and the other is not |             |


### 'All of these are selected' requirement
There is no such requirement within the ICC at this moment. To emulate it,
however, is simple. Just add more than one [Selected Choice] requirement,
and it will ensure that you have each and every one selected.

### 'None of these are selected' requirement
As above, simply add a [Non-selected Choice][NOT] requirement for each ID that 
must not be selected.

### 'Not all of these are selected' requirement
Functioning as a NAND gate.

<!-- TODO -->

### 'All of these are either selected or non-selected' requirement
Functioning as a XAND gate.

<!-- TODO -->

### 'One of these is selected and another is non-selected' requirement
Functioning as a XOR gate.

<!-- TODO -->
