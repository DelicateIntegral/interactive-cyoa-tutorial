## Building locally
To build this tutorial locally, first install `mkdocs-material` (visit
[here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) to learn
more about installing it):

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then run:
* `mkdocs serve` to serve it (with changes being automatically applied), or
* `mkdocs build` to build a static version which can be run without serving
each time and without mkdocs.
