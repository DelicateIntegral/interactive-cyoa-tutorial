more about installing it):

```sh
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-minify-plugin mkdocs-git-authors-plugin
```

Then run:
* `mkdocs serve` to serve it (with changes being automatically applied), or
* `mkdocs build` to build a static version which can be run without serving
each time and without mkdocs.
